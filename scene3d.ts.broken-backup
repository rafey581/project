 * plane at y=0 and the apron box's top face at y=-1 — the apron is 64mm wider and

 * 1mm gap. It has to stay resolvable at the overhead camera's ~4.5m, the farthest the
 * rig ever gets and where z² is at its worst.

 * This was 0.1, which is far closer than anything ever needs to be seen: the nearest

 * MIN_CAMERA_HEIGHT_MM=140. A 0.1mm near spent effectively the whole depth buffer on
 * the first few millimetres in front of the lens — about 12mm of granularity at 4.5m,
 * so the 1mm gap was 12x finer than a single depth step and the depth test became a
 * coin flip. The mahogany apron punched through the green cloth in dark bands that
 * flickered as the camera moved: unreadable at the 90-degree overhead view, and
 * invisible from the cue camera, where the same buffer resolved 0.073mm and left a
 * comfortable 13x margin. 20mm still holds every such surface inside the frustum and
