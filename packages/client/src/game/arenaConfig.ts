/**
 * ARENA_CONFIG — every tunable number behind the World Championship venue.
 *
 * All distances are millimetres and all angles are degrees, the same units the rest of
 * the 3D scene works in. `y` is 0 at the cloth, so the carpet at -790 matches the height
 * the table's legs stand on and `floorY` is the number that keeps them together.
 *
 * The values are chosen to read as a broadcast venue from the two poses the camera rig
 * actually holds, and several of them are chosen for reasons that are only obvious once
 * you know those poses:
 *
 *  - `lightRig.y` sits above `camera.ts`'s `MAX_CAMERA_HEIGHT_MM` (6000) on purpose. The
 *    overhead view climbs as high as 6000mm on a narrow canvas, and anything hung over
 *    the table below that line is drawn between the lens and the bed. The rig clears it.
 *  - `bowl.tiers` and `bowl.wallRadius` together fix the arena's outer radius, which has to
 *    stay inside the perspective camera's 20000mm far plane *plus* the 3000mm the camera rig
 *    is allowed to pull back off the table. The far side of the stand is that far from the
 *    lens, so anything past about 17000mm is simply not drawn.
 *  - `carpet.y` matches `floorY`, and the arena hides the old room's two big planes rather
 *    than trying to sit on top of them, so the two surfaces never fight for the same depth.
 *    That step has to happen *after* `buildTable`, because the two planes it targets are
 *    built inside that call: doing it earlier finds nothing and leaves a floor at exactly
 *    the carpet's own height, which is a z-fight no depth buffer can resolve.
 *  - `render` carries the two renderer numbers the arena is allowed to own. Both are seeded
 *    with the values the scene already used, so enabling them changes nothing until you
 *    move them: tone mapping itself stays the scene's business (ACES, or Neutral behind its
 *    own flag) and this file only sets the exposure it is given.
