 * plane at y=0 and the apron box's top face at y=-1 — the apron is 64mm wider and
 * longer than the cloth, so that face underlies the whole playing surface — which is a
 * 1mm gap. It has to stay resolvable at the overhead camera's ~4.5m, the farthest the
 * rig ever gets and where z² is at its worst.
 *
 * This was 0.1, which is far closer than anything ever needs to be seen: the nearest
 * geometry is a cue butt on its way out of frame, or a cushion nose at
 * MIN_CAMERA_HEIGHT_MM=140. A 0.1mm near spent effectively the whole depth buffer on
 * the first few millimetres in front of the lens — about 12mm of granularity at 4.5m,
 * so the 1mm gap was 12x finer than a single depth step and the depth test became a
 * coin flip. The mahogany apron punched through the green cloth in dark bands that
 * flickered as the camera moved: unreadable at the 90-degree overhead view, and
 * invisible from the cue camera, where the same buffer resolved 0.073mm and left a
 * comfortable 13x margin. 20mm still holds every such surface inside the frustum and

 * centred on the face would read as a sliced tree trunk, not a rail. And the map is
 * mapped 1:1 per face with clamped edges rather than tiled, because an arch pattern has
 * no seamless repeat; the wrap modes below would only hide the seam.
 *
 * The roughness map is the half that sells "polished". Lacquer lies over the earlywood

 * to level and stay dull. Colour alone cannot express that contrast, so a flat-colour

   *
   * Set `window.__DEBUG_POLES__ = true` before the scene is built (or just call
   * `window.__debugPoles()` afterwards) and this prints every mesh whose world-space
   * bounding box reaches `yMin` above the cloth, grouped by its nearest pocket. The point
   * is to answer one question with numbers instead of guesses: *what is standing up on
   * this table, and where.*
   *
   * Four things the first version of this got wrong, all of which changed its answer:
   *
   * - It ignored `visible`. `Box3.setFromObject` walks invisible objects happily, so the
   *   two fixture meshes that are deliberately `visible = false` — the lamp shade at
   *   y≈1900 and the bulb at y≈1790, both parked on the table's centre line — were
   *   reported as the two tallest "poles" in the scene. They cannot be seen; they were
   *   the top two rows of the table.
   * - It excluded the cue with `m === this.stick`, which is a `Group`. `traverse` visits
   *   the Group *and* its five cylinder children, and the shaft alone is 1200mm long, so
   *   excluding the Group excluded none of the geometry. Membership is now decided by
   *   walking ancestors, so a cue is a cue whichever of its parts is being measured.
   * - It read `m.position` for the pocket-distance test, which is local. Anything parented
   *   — every ball rig, the whole cue — was measured from the wrong place and attributed
   *   to whichever pocket happened to be nearest the origin. World centres now.
   * - It `break`ed out of the instanced loop on the first tall instance, so an
   *   `InstancedMesh` could report at most one hit however many of its instances were
   *   standing up. All instances are enumerated now.
   *
   * Everything it walks is a real world-space box, and every instance of an instanced mesh
   * is measured rather than sampled, so a count from this can be trusted to be a count.
