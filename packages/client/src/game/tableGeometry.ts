 * Geometry for the snooker table's moulded parts: the rail cap, the cushion bodies and
 * the brass trim.
 *
 * This lives apart from `scene3d.ts` for one reason: none of it needs a canvas, a GL
 * context or a DOM, so it can be built and measured in a test. Every part here is placed
 * against a dimension that the physics engine also uses — the rail cap's top face sits on
 * the cloth's y=-1 plane and each cushion's inner face sits on its collision plane — and
 * both of those are invisible to a typecheck. ExtrudeGeometry's bevel in particular
 * expands the profile *outward*, which silently pushes a cushion's inner face onto the
 * playing surface and a frame's edge over the cloth. `tableGeometry.test.ts` asserts the
 * real world-space bounding boxes so that cannot regress unnoticed.
 *
 * Shared build-space conventions:
 *
 * - Millimetres throughout, matching `@snooker/shared`.
 * - `u` runs outward from the bed, `v` runs up from the cloth. Sections are authored in
 *   (u, v) and swept along local +Z, so the caller rotates the result onto its rail.
 * - Frame geometry is built in XZ extruding along -Y; swept sections are built in the
 *   local plane extruding along +Z.

 * carries the whole section, so the chamfer runs the full length of all four rails in a
 * single mesh and a single draw call.
 *
 * `innerL`/`innerW` are the opening's full extent measured from the centreline, so the

 * how wide the rail reads.
 *

 * rails face four different ways.
 *
 * The rotation and position are not independent — flipping one mirrors the other, so they
 * have to move together:
 *
 * - Sweeping runs along local +Z and the profile's u along local +X.
 * - `rotateY(-90°)` sends local +Z to world +X but local +X to world -Z, so u points
 *   inward. That is correct for the +Z rail. `rotateY(+90°)` sends local +Z to -X and
 *   local +X to +Z, which is what the -Z rail needs. Getting this pair the wrong way
 *   round puts a cushion inside the playing surface.
 * - On the short rails the sweep already lies along +Z, so only u has to turn onto X: no
 *   rotation for the +X rail, 180° for the -X rail. The 180° also flips the sweep, so the
